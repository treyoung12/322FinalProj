  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h1>What is Sneak Peak?</h1>
    <p id = "faq1">
      Sneak Peak is a place where sneaker heads, hypebeasts, and other fellow shoe fanatics can come and educated themselves on when shoes are dropping, where they are dropping, and how much they cost.  We value ourselves in giving as much correct information as possible when trying to help others with release updates.  We also sell and help verify shoes that are <strong> 100% Authentic </strong> if you do not know what to look for.
